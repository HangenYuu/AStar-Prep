# AStar-Prep
> 1. Try to understand the atomistic structures of peptide, protein, nucleic acid and membrane, and basic principles of molecular dynamics simulations such as force field, conformational sampling etc.
> 2. We will use Gromacs package to run the simulations, try to get familiar with it, there are many tutorials on running simulations using Gromacs, such as:Â [https://tutorials.gromacs.org/](https://tutorials.gromacs.org/ "https://tutorials.gromacs.org/")
> 3. For the AI part, we are currently using graph networks and transformers. You can start by learning the basics of these two frameworks. Many tutorials are available online. In the future, we will also work with diffusion models, so it would be good to start familiarizing yourself with those as well. Be ware, learning how to call and run these models is not enough. You need to understand the mathematics behind them.

My preparation for my job at A\*Star. It consists of 2 parts:
- Molecular dynamics simulation with GROMACS.
- Deep learning with a focus on graph and transformer architecture.
